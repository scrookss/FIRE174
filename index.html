<h4 align="center"><i>Black Panther and its Representation's Impact on Black Expressiveness and Freedom</i></h4>
<h5 align="center"><i>Sophia Crooks and Kayla Graham</i></h5>

<hr>

<p>Our digital archive is focused on how Black audiences are cultivating digital spaces to discuss the implications of Black Panther for Black freedom and culture. We found that majority of the responses were about the positive and realistic Black representation shown in the film, which something most of America has not seen before. Which caused an outcry on a multitude of digital spaces, such as Twitter, because many of the Black audience felt connected and or proud of the representation and accuracy of the representation shown in the film. According to Jules (2016), “digital spaces allow users opportunities to trouble dominant representations, (re)negotiate black identity, and document different narratives of black life.” Black people are finally able to tell their own stories through their own perspectives. They are no longer forced to fit colloquial stereotypes based on the past and they can voice their culture as an individual. Digital spaces allow all people to share their narrative regardless of their social status, race, religion, etc. The way history will be told will be changed forever as everyone, regardless of background, will be able to voice their version of history.</p>
<p>They have made a community on digital spaces to share their gratitude for the film and share the similar stories they had growing up with little to none positive representations of Black people in media. Making this digital community can “replicate modes of discourse present in Black oral culture and serve as a medium through which African Americans can modify facets of Black oral culture to meet the community’s current needs”. This digital sense of community has just recently come into existence and has connected Black people from all over. These digital spaces create conversations that the Black community may not have had or had to that extent before. It adds different perspectives and can include people of all backgrounds.</p>
<p>This sense of community and pride has been shown in our digital archive. Both the tweet thread and the blog article exemplified pride in Black representation and a feeling of community within the digital Black audience. The tweet thread. In particular, a thread by @diasporicblues on Twitter explored the cultural consciousness the filmmakers took in creating this film, by using actual African attributes in the film. Demonstrating the accuracy in the film’s representation and the care they took to make the film a thing many people can relate to and feel proud of. Many people replied to her thread in which a community of people were able to converse about the impact the movie had on them. One user @farhanahfaruque responded, “Thank you so much for posting this thread! I'm so impressed with the amount of cultural accuracy this movie displayed and how much I learned. This has definitely been a starting point for my further exploration and education about the traditions and cultures in Africa!” Having these digital spaces not only start conversations between different members of the Black community but also continues the desire to learn in the Black community. If people can see people that look like them in media and in a positive light they will want to know more about it and or how to get to that point. It changes the audience’s perspective entirely and gives hope that colloquial stereotypes in the media will end.</p>
<p>The blog article, “Black Panther let me see myself as a superhero for the first time”, by Allegra Frank also epitomized the pride taken in media with positive Black representation and a feeling of community within the digital Black audience. In her article, she talks about the many things that made her proud when watching this film. She was able to finally feel connected to a superhero movie and could see herself in multiple characters and wanted to actually look more like them. Simply putting a Black character in place of power in media can show audiences that Black is beautiful and that the Black race is more than just the negative stereotypes. Black people have historically been silenced and have had their stories erased. Through these digital spaces, we have seen how they are using the freedom to contribute to Black rhetoric and history. Many of them today, are using the digital spaces to archive their work and expressions, something that they could not do in the past because their voices were deemed unimportant by the people in power. Black people today can simply tweet something and that tweet will be saved forever on the internet. This gives them a voice that they did not have then because they were not seen as equal to their white counterpart and did not have the resources to make traditional archival work.</p>
