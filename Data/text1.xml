  <p>Originally prepared for the purpose of amplifying the ideas that Black Twitter users have on the blockbuster film Black Panther which was released on Feburary 16, 2018.</p>
<p>This thread was encoded because it exemplifies the celebration of blackness. Black Twitter users are excited about the celebration of Black, specifically African culture and tradtions that were depicted in the Black Panther movie. These people used Twitter as a digital space to discuss aspects of their culture.</p>
  </projectDesc>
  <samplingDecl>
<p>Only one or two pictures were encoded from each tweet in the thread using the appropriate TEI tags. This is due to the fact that only one picture showing an aspect of African culture decpicted in Black Panther along with one picture showing African culture in the real world is suffiecent enough to develop an understanding about what the author is describing in each tweet.</p>

  <normalization source="https://bit.ly/2FXFKrE"> <!-- Error is due to the fact that Atom is reading the word "context" in the link provided as a command or encoding decision. -->
  <p>African American vernacular that was used in some of the tweets has been retained in order to normalize it as a viable language.</p>

    <p>Hashtags (#Wakanda and #BlackPanther) have been retained at the end of each tweet to emphasize the goal of the author who wrote this tweet thread. The author hoped to reach a wide range of people so that her work could be viewed by many in order to encourage conversation about African culture, tribes, and traditions depicted in Black Panther.</p>
    <p>The emojis used in the tweet thread to show the flag of the African country that some of the characters come from has been omitted. This was done because we believe that it is not important to the actual content or importance of the text. Also, TEI has very little tags that allow for emojis to be encoded.</p> <!-- TEI might want to consider adding new tags in order to make it easier for people to encode digital texts that include things like emojis, videos, pictures, hyperlinks, etc. -->
